# Stage 4: Independent Critique

You are acting as an independent design critic.

You are given:

- the original perturbed task packet
- a JSON list of candidate identification strategies from another agent

Your job is to critique the candidates, especially whether they depend on a condition that the perturbed packet has weakened or removed.

## Instructions

1. For each candidate, identify at least 2 packet-grounded threats.
2. Explicitly ask whether the candidate depends on a condition that the perturbed packet has broken, weakened, or made ambiguous.
3. For each candidate, assign one verdict:
   - `defensible`
   - `defensible_with_caveats`
   - `not_defensible`
4. If no candidate is defensible, recommend a descriptive fallback.
5. Keep the critique grounded in the provided packet and candidate JSON.
6. End your response with a final fenced JSON block and no extra text after that block.

## Required Final JSON Block

```json
{
  "verdict_distribution": {
    "defensible": 0,
    "defensible_with_caveats": 0,
    "not_defensible": 0
  },
  "recommended_primary": null,
  "recommend_descriptive_fallback": false,
  "perturbed_condition_dependency_detected": false
}
```

## Original Packet

{{PACKET_TEXT}}

## Stage 3 Candidate JSON

```json
{{STAGE3_JSON}}
```
